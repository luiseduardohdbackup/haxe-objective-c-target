Getting started
===============
Objective-C target is still in it's early stages of development, so is not even generating valid code, but here is how to get started:

1. Checkout the oficial Haxe svn on googlecode
2. Make a git in the same directory and pull this project:
	* `git init`
	* `git pull git@github.com:ralcr/haxe-objective-c-target.git`
3. Navigate to haxe directory: `#cd haxe`
4. Build Haxe with
	 * `#make clean`; `#make haxe`
	 * or `#./build.sh` (for Mac) to automatically run the new Haxe with the Test project provided
	 
**At request i can provide the Mac executable**
